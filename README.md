## Beta

This whole project is currently a beta.

Internals **will** be changed, with both the backend and frontend.

Any pastes uploaded during the beta, will be at risk of deletion, so please do not store anything important here.

No data is encrypted as of yet, 
so also do not save passwords or private information.
(this should be a given,
no paste can currently be password protected,
with no certainty this feature will ever happen.)

Any suggestions or feedback are welcome.
